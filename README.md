## ü§î Why I Built CropTrends

This project began as a college assignment to identify and solve a real-world problem. I chose to focus on agriculture because farmers often face a significant challenge: information is scattered, delayed, and hard to access. This fragmentation can lead to missed opportunities and reduced profitability.

The assignment evolved into a passion project to build **CropTrends**. The goal was to centralize all essential information into a single, user-friendly mobile application. It provides farmers with actionable, up-to-the-minute data right at their fingertips, helping them to maximize their yield, get the best prices, and stay ahead of environmental and market changes.
