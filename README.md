# CropTrends üåæ Your Smart Farming Companion

## ü§î Why I Built CropTrends

Farmers traditionally face a significant challenge: information is scattered, often delayed, and hard to access. To make critical decisions about harvesting, selling produce, and protecting crops, they need to consult separate sources for weather, find reliable market rates, and stay updated on agricultural news. This fragmentation can lead to missed opportunities and reduced profitability.

I built **CropTrends** to solve this problem by centralizing all essential information into a single, user-friendly mobile application. The goal is to provide farmers with actionable, up-to-the-minute data right at their fingertips, helping them to maximize their yield, get the best prices for their crops, and stay ahead of environmental and market changes.
